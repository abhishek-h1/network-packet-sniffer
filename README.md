  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>College courses are centered around learning large theoretical concepts over a period of 3-4 months. For any course project, it is most beneficial to implement a system that integrates all aspects and learning objectives of the specified course. A packet sniffer is a software or hardware device used to monitor and gain insight from one's own - or other - networks.</p> 
  <p>When these sniffers collect streams of data, they unwrap everything that the data holds - the type of protocol, the addresses involved in the data transfer, and long streams of data. To unravel and understand everything from scratch would require a great amount of network knowledge.</p>
  <p>Here, we accumulate all the theoretical material taught to us over the course of the semester (protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP; source and destination addresses; IPv4 and IPv6) and translate in into building a packet sniffer. Hence, to understand the practical significance of our theoretical material in the best way possible, a basic packet sniffer seemed like the perfect software to implement and present.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Operating System: Linux<br></li>
    <li>Compiler: Python<br></li>
    <li>Libraries: <code>struct</code>, <code>textwrap</code>, <code>socket</code></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Run</h2>
  <p>NOTE: It is important to use a Linux system to run this sniffer.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you have all the dependencies required to run the program</li>
    <li>Download <code>sniffer.py</code> from the folder</li>
    <li>Run <code>sniffer.py</code> from your terminal window using the following command: <code>python sniffer.py</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Soon, you should see packets being decoded in your terminal, as demonstrated <a href="https://github.com/ps4449/network-packet-sniffer/blob/main/output/output_1.jpeg">here</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/ps4449/network-packet-sniffer/blob/main/report.pdf">report</a> will give you a detailed overview of what this decoded data means and what the principles behind the data are.</p>
