  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>College courses are centered around learning large theoretical concepts over a period of 3-4 months. For any course project, it is most beneficial to implement a system that integrates all aspects and learning objectives of the specified course. A packet sniffer is a software or hardware device used to monitor and gain insight from one's own - or other - networks.</p> 
  <p>When these sniffers collect streams of data, they unwrap everything that the data holds - the type of protocol, the addresses involved in the data transfer, and long streams of data. To unravel and understand everything from scratch would require a great amount of network knowledge.</p>
  <p>Here, we accumulate all the theoretical material taught to us over the course of the semester (protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP; source and destination addresses; IPv4 and IPv6) and translate in into building a packet sniffer. Hence, to understand the practical significance of our theoretical material in the best way possible, a basic packet sniffer seemed like the perfect software to implement and present.</p>
